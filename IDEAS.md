## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations
- Consider using Chart.js or D3.js for advanced visualizations
- Implement proper state management for complex filters
- Use React Query or SWR for efficient data fetching
- Consider implementing a backend API for user features

### Data Requirements
- Need access to historical data for trends
- Win rate data would require additional API endpoints
- User features would require authentication system
- Real-time features would need WebSocket implementation

### Performance Considerations
- Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Use memoization for expensive calculations
- Consider server-side rendering for SEO
- Implement proper loading states and error boundaries
